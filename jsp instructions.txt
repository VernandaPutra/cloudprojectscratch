CREATE ANOTHER PAGE PENGESAHAN.JSP

java server page, will not be seen by the user.
only server site, user can see the code. 
<%......%> --> this is in JSP coding
<%@..... --> @ is used to import another file (directive tag) (search in google)

Example:
<%@ include file  = "connection.jsp"%>

connection.jsp is used to connect to database (will in final exam)

connection conn = null; (important to establish a connection)
preparedstatement pstmt = null; 
resultset rs = null; (return the results from query)

connection.jsp file

<%@page import = "java.sql.*"%>

<%!				//want to declare something using %! (becomes a servelet file)
Driver driver = null;
String driverUsed = "oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver";
String serverAddress = "jdbc:oracle:thin:@172.16.

Need to have:

JSP connect with Oracle DB, we need:

1) Driver class: The driver is oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
2) Connection URL: The connection URL for oracle10G database is jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe
or
jdbc:oracle:thin:@172.16.60.13:1521:orcl //port number + service name 

get all these info in tnsnames.ora file in sql folder

STEPS TO CALL CONNECTION:

1) load the driver class - DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:oracle:thin:@172.16.60.13:1521:orcl", "userid", "userpwd");
2) create connection object
3) create the statement object: createStatement();
4) execute query: executeQuery();
5) process the resultSet --> to store the return value from SELECT query
6) close the connection object. 

string user = "INSERT_USERNAME_HERE";
string password = "INSERT_PWD_HERE";
